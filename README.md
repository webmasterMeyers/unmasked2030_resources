2030 UnMasked is a documentary revealing the connection between Covid-19, Vaccines, Masks, the Banking System, and the upcoming “Great Reset”.

This documentary is for anyone realizing something is wrong in the world.  Especially for those “just waking up”.   It’s uncomfortable to learn that so many things you’ve been told are untrue and this documentary is intended to help make sense of WHY so many things are happening, HOW they are happening, and also WHAT you can do about it.

## My personal take ##

It as he says in the very beginning of the video, question ***EVERYTHING*** including what he is telling you.

1. COVID is real, and is bad.
2. The arguments about COVID's fatality rate are silly. HIV also does not kill you, it allows a common cold to kill you. COVID may not kill you, but may allow something else to kill you.  It's a chain of events that winds up in your death.
3. I have very little trust in any "numbers" being reported about anything related to COVID, it is ALL a skew especially without the context to what the actual number was related to.
4. The Vaccines are also not proven *safe*
5. If I sneeze openly into a room, shit... I mean spit goes everywhere.  If I sneeze into my sleeve, a facial tissue, or a mask, that sh... spit is somewhat contained.  It's like hiding behind a tree in a wind storm.  It helps.  However, I don't keep that *spit* on my face the rest of the day when I use my sleeve or something else.  Ask your self is it worth it to you?
6. ***If*** you want a vaccine, go ahead and get one.  You the vaccinated are *safe* right?  Why are you forcing someone else to get vaccinated if they are the ones in danger... If you want to stick your finger in a light socket, that's your problem.... don't take away my lights!
